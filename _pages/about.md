Hi! I am currently a first-year Master student in [Computational Biology](https://cbd.cmu.edu/) student at Carnegie Mellon University.

I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Bioinformatics from the [Zhejiang University - University of Edinburgh Joint Institute](https://zje.zju.edu.cn/zje/AboutUs/list.htm).

Research interest
======
My academic focus is primarily on dealing with biomedical problems using bioinformatics analysis, including but not limited to machine learning platforms and container orchestration frameworks. I am also quite interested in developing advanced Machine Learning models to reveal the mystery of Genomics and Proteinomics.

Collaborations
======
Before joining the Carnegie Mellon University, I had the incredible opportunity to collaborate with accomplished researchers in the field.

I worked with Prof. Christine Orengo at University College London, exploring the application of Deep Learning on enzyme design and protein function prediction.

In addtion, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with Dr. Chaochen Wang at Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh and Dr. Jing Xue, studying the important functions of Med12 in pancreatic cancer.

Personal interests
======

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
